### Overview
Dr. [Garcia-Aroca](https://teddyaroca.github.io/online-cv/) trained as a plant pathologist/mycologist at LSU before undertaking a postdoctoral research position at University at Albany. He is now an Assistant Professor at UNL in the Department of Plant Pathology and running **The Fungal Ecology Lab**. His research focuses on using classical plant pathology and mycology, genomics, and bioinformatics to contribute to larger efforts to understand the ecological roles of fungi and the etiology of important plant pathogens in the region.

As a member of Dr. Vinson Doyle's lab at LSU, he worked with an emerging pathogen of soybean that causes a disease known as taproot decline (TRD). Teddy, his two co-advisors, Drs. Doyle and Price, along with many collaborators in the southern United States and across the globe, were able to describe the causal pathogen of TRD as a novel species that likely came from the forest ([Garcia-Aroca et al. Mycologia 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33555993/)). Simoultaneously, the team was able to demonstrate that the foliar symptoms associated with TRD are caused by secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen in the roots ([Garcia-Aroca et al. Plant Health Progress 2022](https://doi.org/10.1094/PHP-03-22-0021-RS)). 

During his research as a postdoc in the [Andam Lab](https://andamlab.wixsite.com/home), he used nanopore sequencing to assemble and report genomes of methicillin-resistant and -suceptible strains of *Mammaliicoccus sciuri*, an important human and animal bacterial pathogen. He also investigated the influence of evolutionary forces such as recombination and selection pressures in shaping the genomes of antibiotic-producing *Streptomyces* spp. On a separate project, Teddy and collaborators at University at Albany focused on estimating the levels of ancestral and ongoing recombination in ESKAPE pathogens.

As a PI, Dr. Garcia-Aroca is leading research towards enhancing our understanding of the emergence of fungal pathogens across many ecosystems, with focus on determining ecological and epidemiological factors that influence the distribution and survival of crop pathogens in space and time.
