This containerized pipeline was developed for high-throughput parallel processing on the University at Albany [servers and cloud platforms](https://wiki.albany.edu/display/public/askit/How-to%3A+Scheduling+via+SLURM#Howto:SchedulingviaSLURM-GeneralPurposeComputing). It was deployed to process whole-genome sequencing data from FASTQ to Figures in RStudio for analysis of the multi-host pathogen **Staphylococcus aureus**.
