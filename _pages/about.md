# **About our research**

Here we describe some of the research approaches we use in our lab:

## Population genomics

Analysis of DNA sequences using high-throughput sequencing to identify patterns of evolutionary history, geographical distribution, genetic diversity, migration pathways, and/or gene exchange between populations.

## Host range

By identifying the range of plant species that can be colonized by known pathogenic species, we seek to determine whether these pathogens are generalists or specialists and whether they represent a threat to plant species that are not known to be infected naturally. This approach also provides insights into the pathogen fitness and survival strategies, including whether the pathogen relies on alternate hosts to complete its life cycle.

## Environmental factors

What factors limit the geographical distribution of a pathogen? We aim to elucidate the abiotic factors that could influence pathogen adaptation to new hosts or environments. 

## Secondary metabolites

Fungi are known to produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites. We seek to determine the types of molecules produced and their influence in pathogen fitness, adaptability, and overall life cycle.

## Enhancing detection methods

Identifying genes and molecular markers that can be used to enhance the current methods used in pathogen detection.

# Technologies and methods
The Fungal Ecology Lab is primarily focussed in plant pathogens and molecular tools to study fungal ecology across ecosystems, including: PCR, real-time PCR, sanger and whole-genome sequencing, metagenomics, RNA-Seq and transcriptomics, and classical plant pathology and mycology. We are also developing some bioinformatic tools that use a wide range of biostatistics and classical statistical methods using open source.

# Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [Doyle Mycology Lab](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/plant/about/faculty-staff/doyle.php) and [Richard's Lab](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/plant/about/faculty-staff/richards.php) at LSU, and the [Andam Lab](https://andamlab.wixsite.com/home) at University at Albany, among others. We are constantly looking for potential collaborators, so feel free to reach out if you have any interesting ideas.

# About this website

Our website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/misc/about/). We downloaded source codes from their repository and modified our contents based on shared templates. We greatly thank for Allan and Trevor for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

The website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://sanderslab.github.io) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanderslab). Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Bedford lab and Drummond lab as the original sources of the lab website template).
