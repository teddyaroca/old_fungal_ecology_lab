# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining The Fungal Ecology Lab. 

### Lab technician/manager

We are seeking someone to help build and manage our lab in the upcoming years. We are seeking someone interested in microbiology and molecular biology, fungi, and ecology, but we are open to applicats with other backgrounds. More details will be provided through email. For inquiries, email our PI using the details on his [public CV page](https://teddyaroca.github.io/online-cv/) or the [Contact](https://www.fungalecology.com/contact/) tab in our main website.

### Undergraduates

We are currently looking for undergrads to help the lab get some preliminary data for bigger research projects. 

If you are interested, please contact Dr. Garcia-Aroca directly using the details on his [public CV page](https://teddyaroca.github.io/online-cv/) or the [Contact](https://www.fungalecology.com/contact/) tab in our main website.

### Graduate students

Dr. Garcia-Aroca is a member of the [Plant Pathology program at UNL](https://plantpathology.unl.edu/academic-programs). We are looking for candidates interested in plant pathogens, fungi, bioinformatics, and/or ecology of fungi at the local, regional, and global scales. Moreover, our interests go beyond plant pathogens and we are constantly looking for students interested a computational biology/bioinformatics, and the genetics/epidemiology of human and animal pathogens.

If you are interested, please contact Dr. Garcia-Aroca directly using the details on his [public CV page](https://teddyaroca.github.io/online-cv/) or the [Contact](https://www.fungalecology.com/contact/) tab in our main website.

### Postdoctoral researchers

We have more data and research ideas than people in our lab, so are keen to recruit exceptional researchers. The lab offers a collaborative and supportive environment and our PI has a strong track record in helping students develop and begin their own independent research careers. The lab has expertise in high-performance computing and analytical pipelines, allowing novel analytic methods to be performed at scale. We have limited funding for postdocs at this time, but soon we will be looking for postdocs from all backgrounds to work on several projects
