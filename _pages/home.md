## Welcome to the Fungal Ecology Lab

The Fungal Ecology Lab at UNL aims to identify the ecological factors involved in the appearance and extinction of fungal pathogens across plant, animal, and human ecosystems, and the implications for the long-term survival of these communities. From the evolutionary history to the etiology of these fungal pathogens, we study the biological and environmental factors that are involved in pathogen adaptation, survival, and epidemiology. 

We are interested in studying known fungal pathogens as well as pathogens responsible for emerging and re-emerging diseases in the United States and worldwide, representing a threat to crops, sustainable agriculture, and societies. We use molecular-level data and traditional approaches to study different aspects of pathogen evolution in space and time. For more information visit [about the lab](about).
